Dear <?php echo $this->organization_name; ?>, <br /><br />

Your license application(s) have been successfully submitted! <br /><br /> 

Our administrators will review each application for completeness and appropriateness before sending a license agreement to you for electronic signature. <br /><br />

After each application is approved, you will receive a notification that an agreement is awaiting your signature. Once you sign the agreement it will be sent to the respective organization for review and counter signature. (Please note that you are not licensed with a group until you receive a counter-signed agreement). <br /><br />

You can click on the LICENSES tab in your profile at any time to view the status of an application. <br /><br />

Regards, <br />
