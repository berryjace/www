A printable report: Daily Patient List
This will be simple table of the patients for the day with their addresses and phone numbers.
Add an Import Data From Previous Visit option/function for 
Wound Treatments
Wound Assessments
This will be similar too the function we currently have for Vital Signs
They use several products in Wound Treatment that we do not currently list in WoundTracker.
We list a lot of products, but, even so, this will likely come up again
Since I don’t know the architecture of these screens, I’m not sure if my current ideas are “an easy fix”
We could simply add their few products to our screens
We could make the screens dropdowns instead of check-boxes to accommodate more options
A later enhancement may be to add customization like we do with Admin Rules and System Generated Patient Care Suggestions.
